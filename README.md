Tracker website to know if Malm√∂ University is online or not. Yep, that's all it does. Gives you a yes or no to the question.

## Background

We're two students from the Interaction Design program at Malm√∂ University and noticed that we and our classmates constantly were having trouble connecting to the various online services at MAU. And of course, being programmers, we decided to have a bit of fun with it resulting in this tiny project.
